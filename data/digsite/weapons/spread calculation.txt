Old tag data does not present weapon spread as an angle, 
rather it applies a velocity error against the projectile in a random direction.
If the random direction happens to be 90 degrees relative to the projectiles vector, 
that would then result in the most amount of deviation from initial vector.

The spread in degrees can be calculated as:

		(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)
<A = arccos----------------------
		(2bc)

			(velocity^2 + velocity error^2 - velocity^2)
error angle max = arccos--------------------------------------------
			(2 * velocity * velocity error)

This assumes the resulting angle is the diameter of spread and not the radius,
but this was done as the values before being doubled resulted in better gameplay.
